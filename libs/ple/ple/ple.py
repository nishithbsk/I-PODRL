        ple.PLE(game, fps=30, frame_skip=1, num_steps=1, force_fps=True, display_screen=False, add_noop_action=True, NOOP=K_15)

        Main wrapper that interacts with games. Provides a similar interface to Arcade Learning Environment.

        Parameters
        ----------
        game: ple.game.base
            The game the PLE environment manipulates and maintains.

        fps: int (default: 30)
            The desired frames per second we want to run our game at. Typical settings are 30 and 60 fps.

        frame_skip: int (default: 1)
            The number of times we skip getting observations while repeat an action.

        num_steps: int (default: 1)
            The number of times we repeat an action.

        force_fps: bool (default: True)
            If False PLE delays between game.step() calls to ensure the fps is specified. If not PLE passes an elapsed time delta to ensure the game steps by an amount of time consistent with the specified fps. This is usally set to True as it allows the game to run as fast as possible which speeds up training.

        display_screen: bool (default: False)
            If we draw updates to the screen. Disabling this speeds up interation speed. This can be toggled to True during testing phases so you can observe the agents progress.

        add_noop_action: bool (default: True)
            This inserts the NOOP action specified as a valid move the agent can make.

        NOOP: pygame.constants (default: K_F15)
            The key we want our agent to send that represents a NOOP. This is currently set to F15.

        state_preprocessor: python function (default: None)
            Python function which takes a dict representing game state and returns a numpy array.

        rng: numpy.random.RandomState, int, array_like or None. (default: 24)
            Number generator which is used by PLE and the games.
